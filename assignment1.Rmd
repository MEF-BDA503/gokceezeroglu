Gokce EZEROÐLU,sales analyst at Avon Cosmetics. I have been working at business analysis department since 2017. My motivation for learning data science is to have broader understanding on deep dive analyses. Currently, programs like python, R, sql, are already being used in my team. Hopefully,  I will also be contributing to scientific based analyses at the end of this program.

I have watched '' the voice of R Community" over  the below link
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_wOnvS1WcA
It  explains the mission of R Consortium, and shares  brief info about the usage of R all over  the world. 
For example
*Age, gender distribution of R users; Why do people use R in workplaces;size of data, being used in R.. and etc.
